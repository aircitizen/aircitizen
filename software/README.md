## Software 

This is the software page of the [AirCitizen](http://www.aircitizen.org) project. You will find here the firmwares and the libraries used in our various air monitoring stations. Install the libraries in your Arduino IDE (Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP library ...), select the board and the port then upload the firmware.

The CN2 and turfu stations are based on Arduino MEGA boards. We provide also test sketches to test the different components (sensors, SD, display, GPS, etc.) independently.
