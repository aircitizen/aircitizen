## Air quality measured by citizens

This is the main repo of the [aircitizen](http://www.aircitizen.org) project. The aircitizen project is a citizen science project about air quality.

We develop air quality measurement stations at [Fablab Sorbonne](http://www.fablabsu.fr) in Paris, France and organize participatory workshops (construction of the stations, measurements in a particular neighborhood, data visualization and discussion, ...) with citizens.

## Development

The project is currently under active development. Feel free to contact us if you want to join !
